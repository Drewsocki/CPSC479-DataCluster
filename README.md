# CPSC479-DataCluster

Andrew Wysocki
What this program should do
- Take in a large data set of objects
- data clustering
  - Use hard clustering (all objects in only one group)
  - Look at the strengths of each cluster and assign them a value for what skill is the strongest
  - Divide the objects into clusters based on their strengths
  - Assign the objects to a cluster that is similar in value
  - Number of clusters equals number of skills

Code steps/Checks
1.Load the data set
2.Pass in the data set into some type of storage
3.Iterate through the data set and compare the values of each data segment and determine a representative value based off those values
4.Cluster the data based off those representative values
5.Provide an example team with an object from each cluster to provide a well balanced team
